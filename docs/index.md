## Features

* **Visualize** entry points, dependency graph, component relationships and scopes in your [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger) setup.

* **Minimal setup** - Scabbard's Gradle plugin prepares your project for graph generation and provides ability to customize graph generation behavior.

* **IDE integration** - Easily view a `@Component` or a `@Subcomponnet` graph directly from source code via gutter icons (IntelliJ/Android Studio).

* **Supports** both Kotlin and Java.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

#### GraphViz

Scabbard uses [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/) to generate graphs and hence requires `dot` command to be available for it to work.

##### Installation instructions

* **Mac** - Install via homebrew. `brew install graphviz`.

* **Linux** - Install via apt. `sudo apt-get install graphviz`.

* **Windows** - Install via [GraphViz installer](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html)

After installation, verify installation by executing `dot -V`, example:

```code
dot - graphviz version 2.38.0 (20140413.2041)
```

## Installation

### Repositories

Scabbard artifacts are served via `jcenter()`. Please ensure `jcenter()` is added to your root `build.gradle`.

### [Gradle Plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/scabbard.gradle)

Using the plugins DSL:

```Groovy tab=
plugins {
  // After Java, Kotlin or Android plugins  
  id "scabbard.gradle" version "0.1.0"
}
```

```Kotlin tab=
plugins {
  // After Java, Kotlin or Android plugins  
  id("scabbard.gradle") version "0.1.0"
}
```

or if you are using older versions of Gradle:

```Groovy tab=
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "gradle.plugin.dev.arunkumar:scabbard-gradle-plugin:0.1.0"
  }
}

// After Java, Kotlin or Android plugins
apply plugin: "scabbard.gradle"
```

```Kotlin tab=
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url = uri("https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/")
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath("gradle.plugin.dev.arunkumar:scabbard-gradle-plugin:0.1.0")
  }
}

// After Java, Kotlin or Android plugins
apply(plugin = "scabbard.gradle")
```

After applying the plugin, configure the plugin by adding a `scabbard` block:

```Groovy tab=
scabbard {
    enabled true
}
```

```Kotlin tab=
scabbard.configure(closureOf<ScabbardSpec> {
    enabled(true)
})
```

!!! success
    That's it. Now after building the project, Scabbard would have generated `dot` and `png` files for your Dagger components in your `build` folder.

!!! todo
    There are some improvements planned for improving plugin configuration syntax from **Kotlin**. Please see [#15](https://github.com/arunkumar9t2/scabbard/issues/15) for more details.

### [Android Studio/Idea Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13548-scabbard--dagger-2-visualizer/)

Scabbard also ships an IDE plugin to open generated `png`'s directly from your source code via gutter icons. Please install plugins from `File > Preferences/Settings > Plugins > Market Place > Search for "Scabbard" > Install` and Restart.

Alternatively you could download the plugin `zip` file directly from [releases](https://github.com/arunkumar9t2/scabbard/releases) and install via `File > Preferences/Settings > Plugins > Gear Icon > Install from Disk and point to jar file`.

!!! success
    That's it. The plugin will automatically add an icon ðŸ—¡ next to `@Component`, `@Subcomponent` or `@Module` as soon as project is indexed.

### Other build systems

Scabbard at its core is just an annotation processor. You could add `dev.arunkumar:scabbard-processor:0.1.0` to your build system's annotation processor config to get it working.
